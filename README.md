# sit-ems

This is an event management project developed for my college(Symbiosis Institute of Technology) competition Code Wars 2018. It is a basic localhost website to store events occurred in the past in the college just as a repository. The faculties can add events on their will and these events are stored in the database using MySQL. The events posted by the faculties are initially in pending state and are handed over to the Information Officer for approval. The faculties can also view past events uploaded by them by using various filters such as search between two dates or serch by department or by standard event name. The faculties can also edit any pending events which are not approved by the information officer. The admin can delete or sign up new faculties. The Information officer can view all the events posted by the faculties.
